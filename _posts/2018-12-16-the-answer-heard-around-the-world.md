When I get the question, “Should I go to Business School?”, I get transported back in time to when I asked that same question of my then mentor. I was in my early 20’s and I had already dabbled in higher education by attending a single math class taught by a friend at a local university. I didn’t do well in the class despite the fact that the teacher was also housing me and I could ask him anything at anytime.

The accepted rules of success didn’t make sense to me. The linear process of going from High School to College to a Job was starting to get some blow back because it wasn’t always working and a lot of people were showing signs of success without following the steps.

At that point in my life I had already begun working in my dream vocation of Special Effects. I had my name in a movie credit and a lot of experience doing things I loved that actually made me a little money. Not a lot, but I was surviving and taking care of myself. Still, with all this experience, I was questioning if I had made a mistake about higher education. Luckily I had a mentor and friend who said, “There are good reasons to go to school but learning how to start and run a business isn’t one of them.” Can I just give a little shout out to Leonard for pointing me straight and not being wishy washy about his advice. I have learned so much from him.

I mention all of that because the decision to not go to business school, or any higher education in my case, was not an easy one. I experienced the same struggles that the people asking me now go through. I take this question really seriously but my answer doesn’t always come across that way. “Hell No!” seems a little abrupt and maybe it is. Sometimes it is accompanied by a slap and a “Snap out of it! Now go and do something.”

If you want to learn how to start and run a business….just start and run a business. There isn’t a formula. Their is time sensitive advice given everyday but you have Google for that. Just do. I left off the Nike “it!” on purpose. Just Do. That is how you learn.
