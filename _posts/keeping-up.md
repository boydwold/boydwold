“It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” – Marcus Aurelius

As you listen to others, notice how you "listen" when they say something that "hits home". Mayybe it is a comment about what you are wearing; how late you are to showing up; a back handed compliment about your looks. Whatever the case may be, notice how intently you listen and how you allow those words to enter your soul.
Is it possible to listen in the same way to yourself?
