Listening to people talk about life experience is so rewarding. Asking simple questions and listening intently can lead to nuggets of insight. The opportunities pop up randomly and I always seem to catch on after they have begun. Last night I had one.

A friend told me about a startup experience he had with three other founders. He talked about the idea, the money, the investor and eventually the failure. A familiar story of a good idea, good people and good intentions finding the bad. In this case, the bad was not knowing how to partner and how to set terms for investment money. He ended with, “It was a good learning experience”. The company and idea died. Money was lost. He gave up on entrepreneurship.

I asked my friend to describe the arrangement and how it all came together and then fell apart. This is when I had the rewarding moment. Even though I had heard the same story many times, I heard something unique this time: tense. The present and future were being muddled together as he spoke. The future is where his idea lived. The decisions were not relevant to the idea and only had meaning at some point in future. He lost sight of solving problems present problems. Contracts, ownership and other “business” issues took his time, gave him anxiety and eventually led to losing most of his savings.

There are better ways of creating. Focus on solving the road blocks that exist now. Let your idea take shape in the now and address the future concerns when they are real. There are many challenges to this concept. The cultural expectations are strong. However, the current rules lead to a 95% startup failure rate. Chances are, you can do it differently. Take the gamble on yourself and stop making decisions based on future unknowns. Demand that your team solve the Now problems only. What have you got to lose…right now?
